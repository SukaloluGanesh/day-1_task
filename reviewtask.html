        - Are you looking for a spicy and delicious Chicken Biryani/ Then try my
        style, “Hyderabadi Double Masala Chicken Dum Biryani”.It always turns
        out perfect, and here is a detailed recipe with images and a video.
      </p>
      <p>
        Biryani lovers find Chicken Dum Biryani a feast. And should we even
        mention the world-famous Hyderabadi Chicken Dum Biryani?
      </p>
      <p>
        There may be many kinds of Biryani but the spice, sourness, aroma and
        taste of the Hyderabadi Biryani are special. Add the Telugu spice to the
        Nizam Biryani, and then you get the very special Hyderabadi Biryani.
        Hyderabadi Biryani is spicier than the other Biryanis, but it is not
        enough to have the spices that are cooked along with the Chicken. When
        it comes to the plate, the spice is not felt. Some of the Rice will
        remain white. That is why they add Mirchi ka Salan and satisfy
        themselves. But this Double Masala Chicken Biryani will ensure that
        everyone gets the spice.
      </p>
      <p>
        When you go to a restaurant, unless you order a “Chicken Biryani with
        Double Masala”, you do not get enough Masala. Even that is served
        separately instead of the one cooked with the Chicken. So, it is not all
        that tasty.
      </p>
      <p>
        In this recipe, I am sharing Chicken Dum Biryani with Double Masala.
        Please do not think Double Masala Biryani is a new recipe. It is almost
        like Hyderabadi Chicken Biryani, but there is just the variation in
        balancing the spices and how the Dum is done.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you want lesser spice, take a look at the Hyderabadi Chicken Dum
        Biryani.

    <h2 style="color: purple" id="tips">Tips</h2>
    <p>
      <strong>Basmati Rice: </strong>More than one-year-old Basmati Rice cooks
      well if soaked for an hour.
    </p>
    <h3 style="color: purple">Why is the Chicken in Biryani Chicken bland?</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        The Chicken needs to be coated well with the chick, and it should be
        allowed to marinate overnight in the fridge, then it absorbs the Masalas
        and becomes very tasty.
      </li>
      <li>
        If there is no time to keep it overnight in the fridge, then coat it
        with Masals and keep it outside or in the refrigerator for 3 hours
      </li>
      <li>
        Though Double Masala Biryani should be spicy, it should be savoury to
        eat. The spice needs to be balanced with Curd, fresh cream or Milk Cream
        and Lemon Juice.
      </li>
      <li>
        Boiling Water should be added to the Double Masala or the spices will
        burn at the time of Dum.
      </li>
      <li>
        Before you coat the Chicken, squeeze Onions hard until they give out
        juice and mix. Only then the essence of the Spices get into the Chicken.
      </li>
    </ol>
    <h3 style="color: purple">Ghee- Oil:</h3>
    <ol>
      <li value="6">
        Biryani needs substantial Ghee; only then it tastes good. People
        sometimes tell me they made it just like I told them, but it still
        wasn’t tasty. That happens because they usually do not add as much Ghee
        Oil and Spices as I have suggested.
      </li>
      <li>
        Biryani tastes better if you use Oil that is remaining from frying the
        Onions rather than regular Oil.
      </li>
    </ol>
    <h3 style="color: purple">Dried Rose Petals:</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Dried Rose Petals give a special taste. Add Rose Water that is used in
        cosmetics if you do not have Rose petals.
      </li>
    </ol>
    <h3 style="color: purple">
      How to make Dum without having the Biryani stick to the bottom:
    </h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Usually, by the measure, when I make Chicken Dum Biryani for four
        people. I usually advise Dum for 8 minutes on a high flame and 7 minutes
        on a low flame and then leave it for 20 minutes. But it would help if
        you cooked on high flame until steam gushes out of this Double Masala
        Chicken Dum Biryani. And if you cook on four sides for 2 minutes each on
        the sim, the Masala will cook without burning. I got a lot of steam
        within 16 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        After cooking the Biryani, if you keep the vessel on the ground for Dum,
        the ground sucks up all the heat. Then the cooking that has to happen on
        Dum won’t happen well. That is why the Biryani should be left on the
        stove after switched off or keep the vessel on a stand.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h3 style="color: purple">Salt:</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        The Salt you add at the time of the Water boiling is what will be added
        to the Rice. That is why you should add more Salt to the water. If you
        taste that water, it should be as salty as seawater. If the Salt is not
        corrected at that time, then you cannot add Salt to the Biryani as it
        won’t get mixed.
      </li>
    </ol>
    <h3 style="color: purple">Some tips for Dum:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Basmati Rice should be added to the Boiling Water and cook on a high
        flame for up to 60%. 60% means the grain should be cooked half and
        should still have a dry element. You will know it when you check it
        under your teeth.
      </li>
      <li>
        The 60% cooked Rice should be spread on the Chicken. If you cook for
        another 5 minutes on a high flame, it cooks to 70%. Add that layer to
        the 60% Rice. Cook for another 3-4 minutes up to 80% and add it as the
        last layer. Biryani is fluffy only if you cook in layers like this.
      </li>
      <li>
        Before you add Cooked Rice to the Chicken, it is essential that you wipe
        away the Spices from the vessel's edges. Or the Spices will burn at the
        time of Dum.
      </li>
    </ul>
